=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::SmartURI - Configurable URIs for Catalyst

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01_01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01_01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    smarturi:
        disposition: hostless # application-wide

    $c->uri_disposition('absolute'); # per request

    <a href="[% c.uri_for('/foo').relative %]" ...

Configure whether $c->uri_for and $c->req->uri_with return absolute, hostless or
relative URIs and/or configure which URI class to use, on an application or
request basis.

This is useful in situations where you're for example, redirecting to a lighttpd
from a firewall rule, instead of a real proxy, and you want your links and
redirects to still work correctly.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin allows you to configure, on a application and per-request basis,
what URI class $c->uri_for and $c->req->uri_with use, as well as whether the
URIs they produce are absolute, hostless or relative.

To use your own URI class, just subclass L<Catalyst::SmartURI> and set
uri_class, or write a class that follows the same interface.

This plugin installs a custom $c->request_class, however it does so in a way
that won't break if you've already set your own request_class.

There will be a slight performance penalty for your first few requests, due to
the way L<Catalyst::SmartURI> works, but after that you shouldn't notice
it. The penalty is considerably smaller in perl 5.10+.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

In myapp.yml:

    smarturi:
        dispostion: absolute
        uri_class: 'Catalyst::SmartURI'

=over

=item disposition

One of 'absolute', 'hostless' or 'relative'. Defaults to 'absolute'.

=item uri_class

The class to use for URIs, defaults to L<Catalyst::SmartURI>.

=back

=head1 PER REQUEST

    package MyAPP::Controller::RSSFeed;

    ...

    sub begin : Private {
        my ($self, $c) = @_;

        $c->uri_class('Your::URI::Class'); # if you need
        $c->uri_disposition('absolute'); # rest of app configured differently
    }

=over

=item $c->uri_disposition('absolute'|'hostless'|'relative')

Set URI disposition to use for the duration of the request.

=item $c->uri_class($class)

Set the URI class to use for $c->uri_for and $c->req->uri_with for the duration
of the request.

=back

=head1 EXTENDING

$c->prepare_uri actually creates the URI, you can overload that to do as you
please in your own plugins.

}

# Reset accessors to configured values at beginning of request.
sub prepare {
    my $app    = shift;
    my $config = $app->config->{smarturi};

# Also save a copy of the context for the Request class to use.
    my $c = $context = $app->next::method(@_);

    $c->uri_class($config->{uri_class});
    $c->uri_disposition($config->{disposition});

    $c
