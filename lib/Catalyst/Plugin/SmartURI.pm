=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::SmartURI - Configurable URI disposition

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Configure whether $c->uri_for and $c->req->uri_with return absolute, hostless or
relative URIs.

This is useful in situations where you're for example, redirecting to a lighttpd
from a firewall rule, instead of a real proxy, and you want your links and
redirects to still work correctly.

In myapp.yml:

    smarturi:
        default_disposition: hostless

In MyApp.pm:

    package MyApp;
    ...
    use Catalyst qw/SmartURI/;
    ...

use Class::C3::Componentised;

sub uri_for {
    my $c = shift;

    Catalyst::SmartURI->new(
        $c->next::method(@_),
        { reference => $c->req->uri }
    )->hostless;
}

    package Catalyst::Request::SmartURI;
    use base 'Catalyst::Request';

    sub uri_with {
        my $req = shift;

        Catalyst::SmartURI->new(
            $req->next::method(@_),
            { reference => $req->uri }
        )->hostless;
    }
}

    my $app = shift;

    my $request_class = $app->request_class;

    unless ($request_class->isa('Catalyst::Request::SmartURI')) {
        my $new_request_class = $app.'::Request::SmartURI';
        Class::C3::Componentised->inject_base(
            $new_request_class,
            'Catalyst::Request::SmartURI',
            $request_class
        );
